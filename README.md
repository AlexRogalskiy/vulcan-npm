## Contribute

For faster development, you may instead want to contribute to [Vulcan Next Starter](https://github.com/VulcanJS/vulcan-next-starter/issues/1). NPM packages will be published in this repo when they reach sufficient maturity.

### Install

Install Lerna

```
npm i -g lerna
```

### Develop

Install packages using `lerna bootstrap`. 

To use Vulcan NPM local install in Vulcan Next, see Vulcan Next contribution doc.

#### Windows

To use a testing database on windows, you could encounter an unexpected issue ; a solution is to download Visual C++ redistribuable.
See https://github.com/nodkz/mongodb-memory-server/issues/475
