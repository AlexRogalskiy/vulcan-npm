## Tooling

### VS Code

Text editors might have trouble providing IntelliSense for Meteor packages. [The following extension from Matt Black](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mattblack.meteor-package-intellisense) provides a script to update your `jsconfig.json` file and thus provide intellisense for Vulcan packages.

Snippets for common features are also provided by the [VulcanJS snippets extension from Apollinaire Lecocq](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Apollinaire.vulcanjs-snippets).

### Commande Line Interface

[A CLI is available](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vulcanjs-cli) for fast generation of new Vulcan packages or modules.
