# Prevent annoying unrealistic peer deps issues with new version of NPM
# Now NPM will fail install if any peer dependency is not well configured,
# this option uses the previous behaviour (warning only, no failure)
# The best solution is always to update the underlying lib,
# if not possible to add an NPM resolution/Yarn override, that's what we do for mdx+React 18
# But this option is needed when none of this work/there are too many failing peer dependencies
