# Run with CodeSandbox

It can be overwhelming to setup a full-fledged Unix environment just to start developing.
If you come from Windows, you first need to setup a Linux dual-boot or virtual machine.
If not, you still need to install Node.js and Docker.

That's why we commit to support running Vulcan with [CodeSandbox Projects](https://projects.codesandbox.io/).
This service is in beta at the time of writing (06/2022) but Vulcan is already setup for it.
Just pick "VulcanJS/vulcan-next" when creating a new project to run Vulcan. 

The interactive tutorial on "/learn" URL will work just as is would work locally.
