# A Remix stack for GraphQL

Remix is popular framework based on React. **Vulcan Remix** brings GraphQL to Remix.

Vulcan Remix is in alpha stage. However, since it's based on Remix "Indie Stack", you can safely use it today.

It is available via the ["Eurodance stack"](https://github.com/VulcanJS/eurodance-stack) or the ["Enka stack"](https://github.com/VulcanJS/enka-stack).
