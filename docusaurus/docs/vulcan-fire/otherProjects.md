# Other interesting projects

- [GraphQL CRUD](https://graphqlcrud.org/), an attempt at standardizing CRUD operations
- [Graphback](https://graphback.dev/) and [Offix](https://offix.dev/), two projects from AeroGear. 
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [Hasura](https://hasura.io/)

Graphback relies on a GraphQL type definition to generate resolvers. Prisma has a similar approach at the database level.

Vulcan Fire prefers JavaScript models, as they can also be reused in other contexts like generating forms or even non-GraphQL APIs.
Contrary to Hasura, Vulcan Fire is code-based. It's much simpler and can be integrated into an existing backend/frontend.
