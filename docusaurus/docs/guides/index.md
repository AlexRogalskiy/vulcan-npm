# The full-stack JavaScript toolkit

Vulcan is a meta-framework for efficient JavaScript full-stack development.

Sounds frightening? Let me rephrase this a little:

**ðŸ”¥Vulcan provides everything you need to build web applications quickly.**

This means:

- an easy way to create the backend of your application, with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- an easy way to create the frontend of your application, with [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- an easy way to store data, with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- an easy way to connect backend and frontend, with premade hooks for fetching or updating data
- a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) turnkey boilerplate, as well as a [Remix](https://remix.run/) "stack" and
  an [Express](https://expressjs.com/fr/) starter
- other nice stuffs such as a pre-made form component and various helpers

## Can I use Vulcan with...

"Meta-framework" means that Vulcan is usable with any framework that is compatible with
either Express (for the backend) and/or React (for the frontend):

- Next.js
- Remix
- Blitz
- Express
- Gatsby
- Create React App
- etc.

We recommend to start with Next.js, and we even provide a boilerplate for you: [Vulcan Next](https://vulcan-next.vercel.app).

It includes a [live tutorial](https://vulcan-next.vercel.app/learn). If you don't know Vulcan yet, follow this tutorial to learn by doing.

Then, come back to this documentation to learn more about the concepts behind Vulcan.
